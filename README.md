## Description
This project was my final assignment for the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive course. The objective was to develop a full-stack app using React for the frontend and Django REST Framework for the backend, which managed data from a Postgres database. Inspired by my love for books and frequent usage of Goodreads, I chose to create a simplified version of a book-related app.

## Code Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:

* Go to the root directory of the project.
* Install the backend dependencies: `pipenv install`
* Enter the project shell: `pipenv shell`
* Start the server: `python manage.py runserver`
* Go to the client folder: `cd client`
* Install the frontend dependencies: `npm i`
* Run the frontend server: `npm run start`

## Brief

#### Requirements
* Build a full-stack application by making your own backend and your own front-end
* Use a Python Django API using Django REST Framework to serve your data from a Postgres database
* Consume your API with a separate front-end** built with React
* Be a complete product which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple of models
* Implement thoughtful user stories/wireframes that are significant enough to help you know which features are core MVP and which you can cut
* Have a visually impressive design to kick your portfolio up a notch and have something to wow future clients & employers. ALLOW time for this.
* Be deployed online so it's publicly accessible.
